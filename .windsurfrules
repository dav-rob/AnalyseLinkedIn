# JobChain - scalable AI job scheduling and execution platform

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Code Style and Structure
- write clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code.
- test code for correctness and performance. 
- prioritize readability,simplicity, and performance.
- use type hints and annotations where possible.
- use appropriate error handling and input validation.
- structure code into functions and classes for modularity and reusability.
- never delete any of the TODOs or comments that I have put in the code as explainers, unless the code logic or variable names have changed.
